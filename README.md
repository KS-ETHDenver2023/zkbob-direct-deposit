# **Alice's ring - zkBob Direct Deposit smart contract**

üéØ Integrate BOB stablecoin and zkBob Direct Deposits functionality into your application.  

üéØ Use Infura and the Truffle suite of tools for L2 and Multi-Network Deployment.

**About zkBob and BOB stablecoin :**

BOB is a decentralized stablecoin with opt-in anonymity and confidentiality features powered by a protocol based on zk-SNARKs. One of the disadvantages of these types of protocols is the sender needs to calculate a proof using their secret key each time, making it difficult to use a smart contract to automate such payments. This problem is solved by introducing the Direct Deposit feature. 
You can now send funds to anyone in the privacy pool directly from the smart contract. This feature makes the zkBob protocol much more composable and suitable for integration where funds transfer can be included as a subroutine to other decentralized protocols. [See more details in the documentation.](https://docs.zkbob.com/zkbob-overview/readme)

## **Configuration** üìù

1. Clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/KS-ETHDenver2023/zkbob-direct-deposit.git
```
2. Install npm
```
npm install
```
3. Install Truffle globally
```
npm install -g truffle
```

We use the **[React Truffle Box](https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/react/)** to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them from a React app. It's a great tool for every developer and it helps us a lot during our development journey.
You can install [**Ganache**](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) for local development and deployment.


## Challenges and benefits when using Infura and the Truffle suite of tools üíª
Challenges :

Our challenges were numerous during the design and implementation of our project.

 - First we had to create a portable, scalable and understandable development environment for the whole team but also in view of a future reuse of the project by other developers.
 - Our project and our smart contracts must be deployed and usable on different networks (L1, L2).
 - Test, correct, deploy... We needed to have a set of easily usable and implementable tools for these actions.

Benefits üõ∞Ô∏è:

1.  **Convenient access to blockchain networks** : Infura provides convenient access to various networks via L1 and L2 endpoints, so we don't need to set up and maintain our own node and configure our own RPC. This save us lot of time and resources, especially during hackathon.
2.  **Reliable and scalable infrastructure**: Infura is built on top of highly reliable and scalable infrastructure, which can help ensure that our dApp remains available and responsive to users.
3.  **Simplified deployment:** Using Infura and Truffle box simplify the process of deploying and testing our multichain dApp.
4.  **Integrated with Truffle:** Truffle provides built-in support for Infura, so it's easy to configure your Truffle project to use Infura's RPC. The process of RPC configuration inside the truffle-config.js is verry simple. 
5. **Truffle for VS Code:** As developers we love using VS Code. The Truffle extension for VS Code allowed us to simplify our development process.
6. **Documentation :** The infura and truffle documentation is very detailed and simply explains via concrete examples how to set up your project.

## Smart contract architecture üìè

The gola for our project was to add, thanks to **zkBob**, the possibility of carrying out anonymous transactions, via a stablecoin, on an EVM chain.
**zkBob** is currently deployed on the **Polygon** ecosystem, which we particularly appreciate thanks to its infrastructure and the quality of resources for developers and users.

We relied on the [zkbob documentation](https://docs.zkbob.com/).

**Direct deposits integration :**  

In order to dev the direct deposit functionality, we had to implement the interface [IZkBobDirectDeposits.sol](https://github.com/zkBob/zkbob-contracts/blob/develop/src/interfaces/IZkBobDirectDeposits.sol) within our smart contract.

Our smart contract interacts directly with the zkBobpool to transfer BOBs from one address to another.
To do this the user must allow+deposit BOBs on our "Alice's Ring Direct Deposit" smart contract. 
Once done, he has the possibility from our web app to transfer BOBs.

One of the advantages of zkBob during our development phase was the good structure of their documentation and the explanations of how their protocol works.
